### testing
Sorry I forgot to add this before. I didn't read this part of the instructions

### this is a new section I guess

### this is the explanation of the game
- This homework is adding crystals together to try to hit the target number.
- When the page opens, each assign a value to each image of a crystal.
- When play clicks crystals it adds together, but they don't know what the value is.
- I guess that makes it a game, but realistically it's very easy to figure out what each value is.
- Add it together to the exact target. If you go over the target, you lose.
